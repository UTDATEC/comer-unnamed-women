important tasks:
- entry card update
- cover photo (ask diane for picture, or go take some with dslr from library)
- matte math for weighted bottom
- ask frontend about outside sim editing
- info card update
- saving json stuff, see below

future stuff:
- curator vs public view
- how to incorporate with existing website. I think vaughan/donnie will know something about this but i feel bad about asking him how to do this


RAMBLING NOTES:

math:: [size of matte - height of art] / 4
take this value and move up the art by this amount to give it some weight at the bottom? ask diane

Once these things are done, we need a way that a frame, matte, image desc, image placement can be moved inside the simulation. this needs to require curator view, need to ask backend team how we can do this
 - we will need a way server side to do this (saving movements). must ask backend what they think about this 
 - we can move it all we want in the sim, but there is no way to save these values
