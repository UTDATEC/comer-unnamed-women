important tasks:
- entry card update (style.css)
  - cover photo

- info card update


future stuff:
- curator vs public view
- remove console statements
- ask frontend about outside sim editing
- saving json stuff, see below

RAMBLING NOTES:


Once these things are done, we need a way that a frame, matte, image desc, image placement can be moved inside the simulation. this needs to require curator view, need to ask backend team how we can do this
 - we will need a way server side to do this (saving movements, image desc). must ask backend what they think about this 
 - it would be nice to alter colors, but the exhibition is already very expensive, so it may be best to just leave it
 - we can move it all we want in the sim, but there is no way to save these values
