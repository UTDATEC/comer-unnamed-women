## NOTES ON CURATOR CUSTOMIZATION:
### matte weighted value:
- there are no safety bounds on this. A photo can be placed outside of its frame using this, which is fine. The weighted value only changes the matte if matte weighted is set to true. 

### frames:
- the frames are set to be a bit larger than originally intended. may remove when there is actual art from the collection, but it fits better like this for now (Frames.js lines 9 through 11)

### custom position:
- there are no safety bounds for this, and to be honest i dont feel like adding them because i feel like it should be 'on the student' whether or not they checked before turning in. This means you can set art outside the bounds of the gallery with no way of viewing it. Maybe create a suggestion somewhere to let someone know that the reason they cannot see a piece of art is because it has an invalid custom position

## Known Bugs:
- fix the event listener problem (click to view): in Render.js, we create event listeners for when a photo is clicked. The issue is that it creates [the amount of times your machine can complete the render function in the amount of time a single click is registered]. This can create upwards of like 2-300 event listeners, causing lag. Not necessesarily a bug, but definitely a performance loss that can be noticeable. 
  - current fix: none, program still works, purely performance issue
