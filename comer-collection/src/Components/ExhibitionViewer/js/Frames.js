     *  The important thing to know about these, are that they are based on the fact
     *  that a frame is created at (0, 0, 0). The frames are moved to their proper
     *  position and rotation in the Art.js file, so it is preferred that you keep
     *  all the math here the same, and alter any minute adjustments in that file.
     * 
     *  Everything is divided by 12 as we are using a conversion of 1 unit in Three.js
     *  as 12 inches or 1 foot, and we are dealing with inch sizes for photos and their frames.
     *  Some things are adjusted by half of an inch (0.5 / 12) because Three.js is using
     *  the midpoints for positioning, and the frames are 1 inch thick in terms of 
     *  both depth and thickness of the frame.
