How to set up and test/use what we have so far:
We used mySQLWorkbench, but you can probably do it in any way that you can set up mySQL tables;
Set up a database and pass in the name and user credentials to the sequelize.js file. Connect to the VPN before running the database. 

Then you can run the front end server using the command npm start. 
The API lives on port 9000. You can run this using node app.js on a second terminal.

Images should appear in a grid view on the landing page. Clicking on an image will take you to the expanded view with more details about that image.
An exhibitions page is set up for users to add their images to.
